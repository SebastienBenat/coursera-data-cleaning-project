## Introduction

The script `run_analysis.R` performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Identifiers

* `Subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `Activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
